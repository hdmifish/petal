# NOTE: selfbots are techincally against discord ToS so please use them only for testing purposes.
# I am not responsible for what you do with this
selfbot: false
# Uncomment lines 9 and 10 to use email/pass (This is not reccomended)
# email: your email
# pass: you password

# Next up Petal is going to need to know your ID.

# ---BASIC PETAL CONFIGURATION--- #

# How often do you want the config to be updated automatically? (300 = 5 Minutes, 600 = 10, 3600 = 1 hour, 86400 = 1 day)
# Do not set this lower than 60 as it is just gonna write a bunch of data over and over and your storage device wont like you

# The interval in which petal checks if users can be un-tempbanned.

# The motd system applies to AskPatch. The AskPatch system posts a message into a channel.

# Filesystem paths to the Minecraft PlayerDB and Whitelist files.
# DB is a meta-document with any information necessary to find out who a player is. This can go anywhere.
minecraftDB: '~/.minecraft/playerdb.json'
# WL is the actual Minecraft whitelist itself. Direct this at the whitelist file in the server directory, or at a file which is periodically copied onto the whitelist file.
minecraftWL: '~/.minecraft/whitelist.json'
# OP is the same as the whitelist file, but for the ops (moderators) list instead.
minecraftOP: '~/.minecraft/ops.json'
# WARNING: This MAY be dangerous the first time, if the people using the !WL* commands do not know what they are doing, because PlayerDB starts empty; It does NOT read from the Whitelist file, for security reasons[1]. Back up your Whitelist file before adding Petal for the first time. After PlayerDB is filled, it should be totally safe.
minecraftStrictWL: false
# This value is whether the whitelist can ONLY contain entries in the database;
# - If false, the only entries REMOVED FROM the whitelist will be in the database AND suspended.
# - If true, the only entries ALLOWED ON the whitelist will be unsuspended DB entries. All non-DB entries will be cleared.
minecraftCommandOpLevel: 3
# If a Discord ID does not have an entry in the PlayerDB with at least this rank of Operator status, that user is not permitted to use whitelist utilities. You should set this to 0 until you have added yourself to the DB.

# [1] If a griefer manages to get opped, this can prevent them from whitelisting additional griefers to come and help them.

#       Level 2 - L3 restrictions as well as BotMute and Restart
#       Level 3 - L4 + Override Role-specific commands. (Kick, Ban, User Mute)
#       Level 4 - Custom Commands and ability to delete images from gallery

# Permissions are not necessary and roles are perfectly fine to use, levels just supercede roles in most cases.

This is a mental health gaming server.\n\nThat being said, we do have a #looking-to-play channel where you can meet other people to play PoGo with.\n\nPlease do not share friend codes or invite links in other channels besides that one. \n\nGo ahead and check the PM you got from my bot friend <@168518865477697539>. If you didn't get one, let someone in the #welcome channel (the only one you can talk in right now) know. \n\nThanks, {self.mention}"
