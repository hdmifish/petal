This is an un-formatted change log offering slightly more insight and dev notes than the commit history.

[v0.4.3 Development]
This is the current version as writing this changelog. Nothing really of worth here besides a mental note of previous improvements.
- !mute now uses the API and Role style muting versus just role
- MOTD/Patch Asks is now on MongoDB versus a local storage.
- Removed Herobrine

[v0.4.4 Development]
After losing my mind over normalized and localized time zones in python, I decided to be lazy and just do arithmetic conversions
You would not believe how long that took versus how long it should have took. Also, the void system had a slight naming glitch.
My fault for using common names.

- Added !tz <source> | <dest> conversion
- !void bug fix
- Added this here changelog.

[v0.5.0]
This has been a thorn in my side for so long. The members system that used a huge json file to hold all the information is now gone.
The module is gone. Everything is databased now.

--6 hours later--
*out of breath, pale,  and sweaty* You ever remember that you forgot to make something and then you realize it can be system breaking and you're just glad nobody noticed?
Yeah....

I can finally start working on cleaning up sections and adding features that people ask for.
- Removed members.py, this may present bugs along the way.
- Converted everything from mySQL to mongoDB
- Lost sleep
- Subscription system now works
- Optimizations and bug fixes
- Lost sleep....

[v0.5.0.1] Bug fixes and making the subscription system work better. Not much to say here.

[v0.5.0.2]
ITS BEEN A LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG TIME.....                                                                                                   since I've felt fine.

Hi everyone, depressive episodes and all have left me in such a state that I have not been really up to doing anything besides sleeping and work-related projects. That being said, it's time for some new petal updates.
Specifically the bug fixes. Theres a couple of really annoying ones. No wories though. Theres been a couple little patches here and there, but nothing commitable as they were mainly patch-centric. So this update is a marker for tthose.

[v0.5.0.3]
Updated the readme to make hosting petal a lot easier for new people who want to use it
Changed config.yaml to config.yml . 3-character file extensions are superior.

[v0.5.0.4] (5/15/18)
Started to add date-stamps so people actually interested in reading these wouldn't have to compare it to commit logs :)
I fixed the laccept bug in which I was not adding all necessary keys to a chopping block object on creation.
Additionally, I fixed confirmation messages for kick and ban to be more user friendly.

Most importantly, I just got a warning on my phone that a small summer hailstorm is 20 minutes out which is my exact drive time on my motorcycle to my apartment.
So I am going to leave it at that. Notes on my survival coming on the next commit : )

[v0.5.0.5] (5/24/18)
After 9 days of hiding out from the insane southern midwest weather during the spring tornado season, I have brought an update. The patch gaming events team, specifically my good friend Galahir, have been pushing and pushing for me to get this update out.
Well, it is finally here.
The subscription system has now been modified to work much more efficiently thanks to a suggestion by Numerion. I probably should have paid attention in Dr. Panda's database class when we were going over normal forms and efficiency.
Thanks to all 3 of y'all for your patience with me.

[v0.5.0.6] (8/16/18)
Petal has been doing very well. Except for the teensy weensy problem of some commands not sticking. So I have added better logging to grasslands.py in an attempt to figure out what's wrong.
Asynchronous prints are a pain.
[v0.5.0.8] (8/29/18)
Pip 10.0 broke embedded pip so I converted the autoupdater to subprocess as suggested by the docs. This should be more thread-friendly anyway.
As well, DAV made a critical commit of removing 8 spaces from grasslands.py which should make things significantly faster.
Finally, added the generate_post_process_URI command, in order to allow people to process their own ban output. Honestly, this is more of a Patch Gaming thing. But, it felt necessary to include it in the update. Documentation may come later if people ask me about it.

[v0.5.7] (10/23/18)
Plenty of updates here, I haven't had time to do changelogs on top of Dav's PRs. Gonna merge with him probably following these again. A couple things about me, I now have a room in the house i moved to, like with a door and everything. Im currently in the process of soundproofing it so that I may return to being able to sleep. Despite turning depression and coffee into code, I do have an annoying hidden stat known as 'SLEEP'. Unfortunately, SLEEP is required and has not been satisfied. 19 hours of classes also have been preventing me from really having time to go through and regularly commit. Big shout out to DAV.

Ok now for the technical stuff. (I have 5% battery left on this SSH'd laptop)

'M': modifications, '+':additions, '-': deprecations, 'T':todos
